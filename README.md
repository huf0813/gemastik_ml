TensorFlow for the Kaggle Titanic challenge
===========================================

From the Kaggle getting started challenge [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

> The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. [...] In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.


Getting Started
---------------

See the [Tensorflow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

TLDR for macOS:

    conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.6
    source activate tensorflow
    pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.5.0-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install jupyter notebook pandas sklearn scipy
    jupyter notebook

Before committing, restart the kernel and run all in Jupyter.
